## Features

- **Zsh Configuration**: Automatically configures `.zshrc` with:
  - Starship prompt
  - zsh-syntax-highlighting
  - zsh-autosuggestions
  - Proxy settings
  - Useful aliases

## Prerequisites

- **macOS**: The scripts are designed to run on macOS. But you can still use it on other systems with some modifications. Try it at your own risk.
- **Remove Existing Configurations**: Before running the script, better to remove existing _Starship_ and _WezTerm_ configurations, it is okay if you don't, you will have to see what you want to keep.
- **Smooth Internet**: The script will download and install various tools and packages, so a good internet connection is a must.

**Once you have done the little things above, you can start to install the script immediately.**
